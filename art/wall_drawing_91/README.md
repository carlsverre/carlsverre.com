# Interpretation of Wall Drawing 91 by Sol LeWitt
## HTML5 Canvas, Dimensions Variable, 2016

LeWitt's description of Wall Drawing #91 is, “A six inch grid
covering the wall.  Within each square, not straight lines from
side to side, using red, yellow and blue pencils.  Each square
contains at least one line of each color.”

After seeing Wall Drawing 273 at SFMOMA I was inspired to create my own
interpretation of one of his pieces.  I chose Wall Drawing #91 since I felt that
its particular set of instructions fit the digital medium well.
