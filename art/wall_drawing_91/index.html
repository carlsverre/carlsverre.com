                <h1>Interpretation of Wall Drawing 91 by Sol LeWitt</h1>

                <p>
                    LeWitt's description of Wall Drawing #91 is, “A six inch grid
                    covering the wall.  Within each square, not straight lines from
                    side to side, using red, yellow and blue pencils.  Each square
                    contains at least one line of each color.”

                    After seeing
                    <a href="https://www.sfmoma.org/artwork/FC.512" target="_blank">Wall Drawing 273</a>
                    at <a href="https://www.sfmoma.org/" target="_blank">SFMOMA</a> I was
                    inspired to create my own interpretation of one of his
                    pieces.  I chose Wall Drawing #91 since I felt that its
                    particular set of instructions fit the digital medium well.
